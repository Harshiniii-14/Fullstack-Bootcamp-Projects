## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio designed to serve as a central hub for my work, skills, and professional background. The primary goal was to create a visually compelling and fully responsive website that not only provides information but also reflects my personality and passion for aesthetic design.

This project was built from the ground up as a capstone, demonstrating a strong understanding of modern front-end fundamentals. It leverages the Bootstrap 5 framework for a robust, responsive grid system while incorporating significant custom CSS to achieve its unique, retro-space aesthetic.
