# 🎮 Simon Game (jQuery) Mini Project

A browser-based implementation of the **classic Simon memory game** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Simon Game challenges players to memorize and repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors.

**How it works:**

* The game flashes a sequence of colors.
* The player must repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.
* Each level adds one new color.
* A wrong input ends the game and allows the user to restart.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Structure of the game UI
* **CSS** – Styling, animations, and visual feedback
* **JavaScript** – Core game logic
* **jQuery** – DOM manipulation and event handling

## 🧱 HTML Structure

* **Title (`#level-title`)** – Displays game state and current level
* **Game Buttons (`.btn`)** – Four colored buttons (red, blue, green, yellow)
* Each button has a unique `id` to identify user input

---

## 🎨 CSS Styling

* `.btn` – Button size, border, and layout
* Color classes – Assign background colors
* `.pressed` – Button press animation
* `.game-over` – Screen flash effect on failure

CSS handles **visual feedback**, keeping JavaScript focused on logic.

## 🧠 JavaScript Game Logic

### Game State Variables

* `buttonColours` – All possible colors
* `gamePattern` – Sequence generated by the game
* `userClickedPattern` – User’s input sequence
* `level` – Current level
* `started` – Prevents restarting mid-game

---

### Starting the Game

* Game starts when the user presses any key
* Initializes level and generates the first color

---

### Generating the Sequence

* Clears previous user input
* Adds one random color to `gamePattern`
* Animates and plays sound for the new color

---

### Handling User Input

* Detects button clicks
* Stores clicked colors
* Plays sound and animation
* Checks the latest input against the game pattern

---

### Answer Validation

* Compares user input and game pattern **step-by-step**
* If correct and complete → next level
* If incorrect → game over

---

### Game Over & Restart

* Plays error sound
* Shows visual feedback
* Resets all game variables

---

## ✅ Key Learnings

* Event-driven programming
* Array comparison and indexing
* Game state management
* jQuery-based DOM manipulation

🎉 This project strengthens foundational JavaScript and jQuery skills through practical gameplay logic.
